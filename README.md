- Hello! This is 顧 芃坤 (Pengkun Gu). 

- I've born in 2001 and grown up in Nankai district of Tianjin City, which endowed me the preferences about eating. 
I LOVE the local breakfast foods "煎餅果子" and "豆腐腦" and "鍋巴菜" and so on... 
And maybe, Tianjin gived me a little bit Tianjin-style accent too.

- And I've been studying in the "School of the Gifted Young" of USTC (i.e. University of Science and Technology of China) as an undergraduate since 2018, majoring mathematics. I'm now living in Hefei City, Anhui Province. 
(To be explicit, I used to attracted to the area closed to complex geometry and algebraic geometry, and now I'm more interested (roughly and vaguely) in areas about statistics and machine learning and neuroscience.) 
I'll be appling for graduate programs or PhD programs in 2022 fall. 

- I'm accompanied by 2 cats, who began to step into my life since the March of 2021. They assisted me holding good mood during the hardest and saddest time. Here I give the special untellable thanks to them.
