- Hello! This is 顧 芃坤 (Pengkun Gu). 

- I've born in 2001 and grown up in Nankai district of Tianjin City, which endowed me the preferences about eating. 
I LOVE the local breakfast foods "煎餅果子" and "豆腐腦" and "鍋巴菜" and so on... 
And maybe, Tianjin gived me a little bit Tianjin-style accent too.

- I'm accompanied by 2 cats, who began to step into my life since the March of 2021. Here I give the special untellable thanks them. Sadly 1 of them perished in winter of 2021 due to liver or kidney disease, and here I express my ultimate lament to her. RequiesCAT in Pace!
